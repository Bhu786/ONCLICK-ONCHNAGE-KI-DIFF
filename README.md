Form validation can be triggered by both onclick and onchange events, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.

1. Using onclick for Form Validation:
This is typically used when you want to trigger validation just before the form is submitted, or when a button is clicked.
You would check all the input values and then submit the form if they are valid.
This method is most common when the user clicks the "Submit" button.
Example:

```
<form id="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()">
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" placeholder="Enter your name">
    <button type="submit" onclick="return validateForm()">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
    function validateForm() {
        var name = document.getElementById('fname').value;
        if (name == "") {
            alert('Name must be filled out');
            return false;  // Prevent form submission
        }
        return true;  // Allow form submission if valid
    }
</script>
```

In this case, onclick is used to call the validateForm() function, which performs validation when the user clicks the submit button.
2. Using onchange for Form Validation:
This is used to validate form fields dynamically as the user interacts with them.
When a fieldâ€™s value changes (such as typing or selecting an option), the onchange event is triggered, and you can validate that specific input field.
This is useful for validating input fields as they are being filled in, giving real-time feedback to the user.
Example:

```
<form id="myForm">
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" placeholder="Enter your name" onchange="validateName()">
    <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
    function validateName() {
        var name = document.getElementById('fname').value;
        if (name == "") {
            alert('Name must be filled out');
        }
    }
</script>
```


In this example, the onchange event triggers validateName() whenever the user changes the value in the fname input field. It checks if the name is empty and shows an alert.
Key Differences:
onclick: Used when you want to trigger validation upon a user action like clicking a button or a link. This is often used for validating the entire form just before submitting.
onchange: Used to trigger validation as soon as the value of an input field changes. It allows for real-time validation, giving the user feedback as they interact with the form fields.
Using Both Together:
You can combine both events for more comprehensive validation. For example, you could validate fields immediately as they are changed (onchange), and then perform an overall check when the form is submitted (onclick).

Example:

```
<form id="myForm" onsubmit="return validateForm()">
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" placeholder="Enter your name" onchange="validateName()">
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="Enter your email" onchange="validateEmail()">
    <button type="submit" onclick="return validateForm()">Submit</button>
</form>

<script>
    function validateName() {
        var name = document.getElementById('fname').value;
        if (name == "") {
            alert('Name must be filled out');
        }
    }

    function validateEmail() {
        var email = document.getElementById('email').value;
        if (!email.includes('@')) {
            alert('Please enter a valid email');
        }
    }

    function validateForm() {
        var name = document.getElementById('fname').value;
        var email = document.getElementById('email').value;
        if (name == "" || email == "") {
            alert('All fields must be filled out');
            return false;  // Prevent form submission
        }
        return true;  // Allow form submission if valid
    }
</script>
```

Here, onchange handles individual field validation, while onclick ensures the overall form is valid before submission.
